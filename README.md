🌍 **1 km × 1 km Air Pollution Forecasting (AI + Geospatial Model)**

### *Near-real-time PM2.5 & PM10 prediction using Satellite, Weather & Ground sensor data*

This repository contains the full workflow, code, and documentation for building a **geospatial AI model** that forecasts air pollution (PM2.5 & PM10) at a **1 km × 1 km resolution**.
It uses **satellite data, ground-monitoring sensors, weather data, LULC, elevation, road density** and multiple urban-growth proxies to model spatio-temporal pollution patterns.

## 📌 **Project Aim**

To develop a **grid-based, 1 km × 1 km AI model** that predicts PM2.5 and PM10 across the study region using 5+ years of hourly satellite, weather, and ground-based data.
